###BLOCKS
hi,there!
Here is my second game released!
Like the last one,
it is a tiny game based on cocos2dx.
I did it only for my own study due to my bad memory.
And practice makes perfect!

I am a unsocial guy, so i guess no one will discover this.
But, i just dont care.

Anyway:
####It's a Tetris clone of my own.
* C++
* Cocos2dx 3.3
* Cocos Studio 2.0
* vs2013

I finished almost all the basic Mechanics about Tetris.
__like__: hard drop, wall kick ,lock delay.
just the basic staff.
and that is it.

Here is some pictures of the game:
